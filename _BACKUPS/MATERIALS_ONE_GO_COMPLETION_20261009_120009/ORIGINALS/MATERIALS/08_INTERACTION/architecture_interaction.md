# ARCHITECTURE INTERACTION

## Purpose and scope
Define how building materials contact, support, join, coat, drain onto, or transfer conditions to other architectural materials.

## Required controls
Record assembly and interface IDs, material layers, joining method, contact geometry, load or moisture pathway, construction evidence, and uncertainty.

## Evidence and uncertainty
Record the source, provenance, confidence, uncertainty, applicable context, and version for every material-specific claim. Use UNKNOWN when information is not established. Use NOT_APPLICABLE only when the field genuinely does not apply. Label production reconstruction explicitly.

## Ownership and boundaries
This document governs its named MATERIALS domain. It does not silently take ownership of costume design, object identity, architectural layout, environmental simulation, camera, lighting implementation, or compositing. Use stable cross-folder IDs and explicit handoff records.

## Validation and failure handling
Architecture owns spatial and assembly design; MATERIALS owns physical material identity and response.

Record checks as PASS, PASS_WITH_LIMITATIONS, FAIL, or NOT_TESTED. Do not report a test as passed without evidence. Critical physical, historical, identity, or continuity contradictions block approval.

## Completion status
This document establishes the operational rules for this domain. Material-specific facts, assignments, approvals, and external tests remain pending until supported by records.
